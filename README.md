# Large Music Collection Visualisation
Procedurally Generated Navigable Environment Based on Extracted Features from Music Collectionsâ€™ aimed to create a unique way for users to interact with and listen to their music collections. A user can log in using their spotify account and the application will receive their music collection. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for genre classification and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of extracted features onto a 2-dimensional space. Web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used to render and display an environment for a user to enjoy


## Project Structure
